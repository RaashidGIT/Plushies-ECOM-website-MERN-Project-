To set up and run a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack application, you'll typically follow these steps. Below are the command lines required for each part of the stack:

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js and npm: You can download it from nodejs.org.
MongoDB: You can use a local installation or a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas.
Setting Up the Project

Create the Project Directory:


mkdir mern-stack-app
cd mern-stack-app
Initialize the Node.js Backend:


mkdir backend
cd backend
npm init -y
Install Express and Other Backend Dependencies:


npm i express cors mongodb mongoose
Create Your Server File: Create a file named server.js in the backend directory and set up a basic Express server.

Setting Up the Frontend
Create the React Frontend: In a new terminal window, go back to your main project directory and run:


cd frontend
npm install axios
Connecting the Backend and Frontend
Update Your server.js: Add the necessary middleware for CORS and set up routes.

Set Up MongoDB Connection: In your backend/server.js, connect to MongoDB using Mongoose.

Running the Applications
Run the Backend: In the backend directory, run:


node server.js
If you're using Nodemon for automatic restarts, install it globally or as a dev dependency:


npm install -g nodemon
Then, you can run:


nodemon server.js
Run the Frontend: In the frontend directory, run:


npm start
Summary of Commands
Hereâ€™s a quick summary of the commands:


# Create the project directory
mkdir mern-stack-app
cd mern-stack-app

# Set up the backend
mkdir backend
cd backend
npm init -y
npm install express mongoose cors dotenv

# Set up the frontend
cd ..
npx create-react-app frontend
cd frontend
npm install axios

# Run the applications
# In the backend directory
node server.js
# or if using nodemon
nodemon server.js

# In the frontend directory
npm start
Additional Notes
Make sure your MongoDB server is running (if using a local database).
Update your backend API endpoints to communicate with your frontend.
Ensure that both the backend and frontend are configured to use the same port or handle CORS properly.
This should give you a basic setup to run a MERN stack application. Adjust and expand as needed for your specific project!
